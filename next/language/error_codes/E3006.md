# E3006

There is no individual visibility control fro enum constructors.

Usually, this means that you put an `priv` or `pub` visibility modifier on a enum constructor.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
enum A {
  priv A1
  pub A2
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier from the definition of the enum constructor:

```moonbit
enum A {
  A1
  A2
}
```
